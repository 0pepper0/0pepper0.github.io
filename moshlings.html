        <p>Moshlings are the pets of Moshi Monsters. There are 290 named Moshlings as well as several unnamed Moshlings. Moshlings can be caught by growing specific combinations of plants in your Monster's garden. These combinations are of specific species of plants with specific colour combinations, making some Moshlings rarer than others. Through completing the story line you can also unlock special Super Moshlings which cannot be caught.</p>
        <p>The page below shows a list of all moshlings available sorted into the different types.</p>
